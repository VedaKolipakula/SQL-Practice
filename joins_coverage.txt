### INNER JOIN

1. List every employee with their department name, returning only employees whose `department_id` matches an existing department.
2. Show each department name along with the total number of employees in that department, including only departments that have at least one employee.
3. Find employees whose salary is higher than the average salary of their own department.

### LEFT JOIN

4. List all employees and their department names, showing `NULL` for the department when an employee has no matching department.
5. For each employee, indicate whether their department exists using a derived column (e.g., `has_valid_department`).
6. Identify employees whose department exists but the department does not have a manager assigned.

### RIGHT JOIN

7. List all departments and the employees assigned to them, including departments with zero employees.
8. Identify departments that currently have no employees assigned.

### FULL OUTER JOIN (or emulation)

9. Produce a combined list showing employees with departments, employees without departments, and departments without employees.
10. Recreate the result of a full outer join between employees and departments using left joins and `UNION ALL`.

### SELF JOIN

11. Display each employee along with their manager’s full name.
12. List all pairs of employees who belong to the same department, excluding self-pairings.
13. Find employees who earn a higher salary than their direct manager.
